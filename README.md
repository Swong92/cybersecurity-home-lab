# Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Overview
This project documents a personal cybersecurity home lab built using VirtualBox.
The lab consists of a Kali Linux attacker machine and a Windows 10 target machine
configured on an isolated host-only network for safe testing and reconnaissance.

## Lab Environment
- Hypervisor: VirtualBox
- Attacker VM: Kali Linux 2025.x
- Target VM: Windows 10
- Host OS: Windows 11

## Network Configuration
- Kali Linux:
  - NAT adapter for internet access
  - Host-only adapter for isolated lab communication
- Windows 10:
  - Host-only adapter only (no internet access)

Both virtual machines reside on the 192.168.56.0/24 subnet.

## Connectivity Testing

Initial connectivity tests were performed using ICMP echo requests.

- Windows successfully pinged the Kali Linux system.
- ICMP traffic from Kali to Windows was initially blocked by Windows Defender Firewall.
- After enabling ICMPv4 echo request rules, bidirectional connectivity was verified.

This demonstrated default host-based firewall protections and controlled access.
## Nmap Scanning

### Host Discovery
Nmap was used to confirm the availability of the Windows target on the
host-only network.

### Basic Port Scan
A basic TCP port scan was performed from the Kali Linux system against
the Windows 10 target.

All scanned ports were reported as filtered, indicating that Windows
Defender Firewall was actively blocking unsolicited inbound connections.
This reflects a hardened default security posture and reduced attack surface.

### Service and OS Detection
Service and OS detection scans returned the same results due to all
ports being filtered, preventing further enumeration.

## Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux
- Windows 10
- Nmap
- Windows Defender Firewall

## Skills Demonstrated
- Virtual machine setup and management
- Network segmentation using host-only networking
- Firewall behavior analysis

 ## Wireshark Packet Capture

Wireshark was used on the Kali Linux system to capture and analyze
network traffic on the host-only interface.

ICMP echo request and reply traffic was generated by pinging the
Windows 10 target system. Packet filtering was applied to isolate
ICMP traffic for analysis.

Captured packets demonstrated protocol layering, including Ethernet,
IP addressing, and ICMP message types. This lab reinforced packet-level
visibility and basic traffic analysis techniques used in network
security and incident response.

- Basic reconnaissance and port scanning
- Security-focused documentation


## Status
This repository is actively updated as I complete new labs.

## Lab 2: Wireshark – Compare Allowed vs Blocked Traffic

### Objective
Capture and compare network traffic to validate how Windows Defender Firewall
impacts ICMP communication between a Kali Linux attacker VM and a Windows 10 target VM.

### Environment
- Kali Linux (Wireshark capture host)
- Windows 10 (target)
- VirtualBox host-only network: 192.168.56.0/24

### Procedure Summary
1. Started Wireshark capture on the host-only interface.
2. Filtered traffic using `icmp`.
3. Generated ICMP traffic from Kali to Windows using ping.
4. Observed **blocked behavior**: Echo Requests without Echo Replies.
5. Enabled Windows inbound rule: **Echo Request (ICMPv4-In)**.
6. Re-tested ping and observed **allowed behavior**: Echo Requests and Echo Replies.

### Findings
- When ICMP was blocked, Wireshark showed outbound Echo Requests from Kali
  with no response from Windows, indicating the firewall dropped inbound ICMP.
- After enabling the Windows ICMPv4 inbound rule, Wireshark showed successful
  request/reply pairs, confirming the firewall rule change allowed ICMP traffic.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Packet capture and filtering (Wireshark)
- Firewall rule validation (Windows Defender Firewall)
- Evidence-based troubleshooting using packet-level visibility
