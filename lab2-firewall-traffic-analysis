## Lab 2: Wireshark – Compare Allowed vs Blocked Traffic

### Objective
Capture and compare network traffic to validate how Windows Defender Firewall
impacts ICMP communication between a Kali Linux attacker VM and a Windows 10 target VM.

### Environment
- Kali Linux (Wireshark capture host)
- Windows 10 (target)
- VirtualBox host-only network: 192.168.56.0/24

### Procedure Summary
1. Started Wireshark capture on the host-only interface.
2. Filtered traffic using `icmp`.
3. Generated ICMP traffic from Kali to Windows using ping.
4. Observed **blocked behavior**: Echo Requests without Echo Replies.
5. Enabled Windows inbound rule: **Echo Request (ICMPv4-In)**.
6. Re-tested ping and observed **allowed behavior**: Echo Requests and Echo Replies.

### Findings
- When ICMP was blocked, Wireshark showed outbound Echo Requests from Kali
  with no response from Windows, indicating the firewall dropped inbound ICMP.
- After enabling the Windows ICMPv4 inbound rule, Wireshark showed successful
  request/reply pairs, confirming the firewall rule change allowed ICMP traffic.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Packet capture and filtering (Wireshark)
- Firewall rule validation (Windows Defender Firewall)
- Evidence-based troubleshooting using packet-level visibility
